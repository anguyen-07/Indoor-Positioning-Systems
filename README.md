Indoor Positioning Systems: Predicting Location via kNN

Indoor positioning systems (IPS) use WiFi signals from network access points within a wireless local area network (LAN) to track people and objects inside stores, warehouses, hospitals, and factories. The system requires a reference data set that contains signal strength measurements between wireless mobile devices (i.e. cellular phone, laptop, etc.) and fixed access points (i.e. routers) at known locations within the test environment. A model for the location can then be trained as a function of the signal strengths between the devices and each access point. This model can then be used to predict the locations of new, unknown devices based on the detected signals for the device.
